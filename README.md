# I/O

**Input vs Output.** A tiny trading-terminal strip that gamifies work.

```
┤ I/O ├
REV ........ +4.00
```

A small DOS box. Green is the frame while you are clocked in. Amber is money. The revenue digits scramble, then settle, once a second. Clocked out, the box is dim grey on black. Open **+** for time, money, and the hourly rate. Points print as bright lines, not a counter.
- A paid invoice floats a green `+$200` for everyone watching this strip. That sale is not added to your wages.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5000 — click the strip to clock in/out.

Demo hour = 10s. Real hour:

```bash
curl -X PATCH localhost:5000/api/config \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"hourDurationMs":3600000}'
```

## Push to your empty GitHub repo

```bash
# from this folder
git init -b main
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit: I/O trading-terminal work HUD"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Ferxxo-pa/I-O.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Square

Put a Square access token in the environment (`SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and optionally location and team member ids). The server reads that team member's wage into **$/HR**. Every 15 seconds it checks invoices:

- Sent to a customer (unpaid or paid) → **+1** point
- Paid → a floating **+$200** (or whatever was collected), with the invoice title

Subscribe Square webhooks to `POST /api/square/webhook` for `invoice.published` and `invoice.payment_made`, and set `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY` plus `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_NOTIFICATION_URL` to that exact URL.

Square does not publish a customer-messages API. Points follow invoices you send, which is the outbound message Square records.
